# C++ Basics Learning Repository

This repository is designed to help you learn C++ from the ground up, with organized starter code and solution folders for each topic.

## Structure

- `basics/` — Fundamental C++ concepts (arrays, loops, functions, pointers, etc.)
  - `starter-code/` — Starter code templates for each topic
  - `sols/` — Your solutions and practice code
- `Algorithms/` — Classic algorithms and problem-solving techniques
  - `starter-code/` — Templates for sorting, searching, recursion, dynamic programming, etc.
  - `sols/` — Your solutions
- `OOP/` — Object-Oriented Programming concepts (classes, inheritance, polymorphism, encapsulation)
  - `starter-code/` — Starter code for OOP topics
  - `sols/` — Your solutions
- `STL/` — Standard Template Library (vector, map, set, algorithms)
  - `starter-code/` — Starter code for STL usage
  - `sols/` — Your solutions

## How to Use

1. **Start with `starter-code/`**: Each topic has a template file with TODOs. Try to solve the problems or fill in the code yourself.
2. **Write your solution in `sols/`**: Copy the starter code or write your own solution in the corresponding file in the `sols/` folder.
3. **Experiment and Learn**: Use these files to experiment, make mistakes, and learn C++ hands-on.

## Notes
- `.dSYM` and other build artifacts are ignored via `.gitignore` and should not be committed.
- This repo is for learning and experimentation. Feel free to add more topics or folders as you progress!

Happy coding!
